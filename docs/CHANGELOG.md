# Changelog

## 2026-02-16

- Rewrote [README.md](../README.md) with project description, quick start, testing, and documentation links
- Created [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) with setup steps and verify command
- Created [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) with gameplay overview and build instructions
- Added [docs/BUILD_RETROSPECTIVE.md](docs/BUILD_RETROSPECTIVE.md) -- retrospective on the parallel-agent build process, covering what worked (modular files, parallel authoring, Playwright testing), what didn't (no shared data contracts, over-scoping, canvas timing), and what to do differently (interface contracts first, minimum viable scope, batched builds with integration checkpoints).
- Simplified [parts/constants.js](parts/constants.js) -- narrowed FORENSIC_TESTS to blood typing and RFLP only (removed STR, mtDNA, restriction digest) per scope reduction; removed hair and fiber from EVIDENCE_TYPES since no available test supports them.
- Fixed [parts/data_generation.js](parts/data_generation.js) -- fixed data structure mismatch where `generateTestResult()` nested data under `result.data` instead of merging properties directly onto the result object; fixed `generateRFLPResult()` to return single enzyme `{enzyme, fragments}` instead of all enzymes; fixed `generateBloodTypeResult()` to separate `bloodType` and `rhFactor` fields; added `buildSuspectReferenceProfiles()`, `generateControlFragments()`, and `buildSuspectSTRProfiles()` helpers for gel comparison lanes.
- Rewrote [parts/lab_phase.js](parts/lab_phase.js) -- replaced dropdown-based lab UI with button-based interface for sample selection and test type selection; added `selectSample()`, `buildTestButtons()`, `runTestDirect()` functions; rewrote `showInterpretationForm()` from textarea to 5 button choices (Definitive Match, Consistent With, Partial Match, Inconclusive, Excludes Suspect(s)); added `scoreInterpretationChoice()` for button-based scoring; fixed canvas rendering timing by wrapping `renderGel` calls in `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Updated `parts/style.css` -- added lab button grid styles (`.lab-section`, `.lab-button-grid`, `.lab-sample-btn`, `.lab-test-btn`), interpretation button styles, and accusation card styles (`.accusation-grid`, `.accusation-card`).
- Added `parts/style.css` -- comprehensive CSS stylesheet for the DNA Forensics Investigation Game with a "Knives Out" mansion murder mystery dark theme.
- Added [parts/characters.js](parts/characters.js) -- victim definition (Dr. Victor Graves), 6-suspect CHARACTER_POOL with unique DNA profiles, and `initializeCharacters()` for game setup.
- Added [parts/data_generation.js](parts/data_generation.js) -- scene generation, evidence item creation, and forensic test result generators (blood typing, RFLP) with difficulty-based degradation and mixing.
- Added [parts/scene_phase.js](parts/scene_phase.js) -- scene investigation phase module with evidence collection, gloves/contamination mechanic, chain of custody scoring, collection dialog, and evidence sidebar updates.
- Added [parts/lab_phase.js](parts/lab_phase.js) -- laboratory analysis phase with button-based sample selection, test running, result display (blood typing, RFLP), interpretation scoring, and sidebar updates.
- Added [parts/gel_rendering.js](parts/gel_rendering.js) -- canvas gel electrophoresis rendering with logarithmic band positioning, size ladder, glow effects, and modal enlargement.
- Added [parts/timer.js](parts/timer.js) -- countdown timer system with start, stop, pause, resume, and color-coded display (green/yellow/red) with CSS warning and critical classes.
- Added [parts/save_load.js](parts/save_load.js) -- localStorage persistence for saving and loading game state under the key `forensic_detective_save`, with continue-from-save support.
- Added [parts/ui_rendering.js](parts/ui_rendering.js) -- shared UI rendering functions for setup screen (difficulty cards, suspect selection), intro briefing narrative, modal overlay, notifications, phase navigation, and suspect sidebar cards.
- Added [parts/init.js](parts/init.js) -- main entry point with DOMContentLoaded bootstrap, saved game detection, and keyboard shortcuts (Escape, 1/2/3 for phase navigation).
- Added [parts/case_board.js](parts/case_board.js) -- case board phase with evidence summary table, suspect assessment cards (suspicion sliders, notes, evidence tags), conclusion textarea, accusation flow with confirmation dialog, round end score breakdown, and game over screen with reveal, letter grade, educational summary, and methodology feedback.
- Added [parts/scoring.js](parts/scoring.js) -- scoring engine that evaluates scientific rigor across 8 categories (sample handling, chain of custody, test selection, control usage, interpretation, conclusion quality, contamination penalty, efficiency bonus) with keyword-based text analysis for scientific language.
- Added [parts/educational.js](parts/educational.js) -- educational content system with help topics (blood typing, RFLP, evidence collection, contamination, controls, interpretation), concept tooltips, test result explanations, and end-game forensic science summary.
